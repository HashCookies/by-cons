      <h2><small>Our Approach – Key Differentiator: </small> Lateral Thinking</h2>
      <p>In our approach to business solutions, we use Lateral Thinking methodology.  Lateral Thinking is less concerned with the path to a successful result than achieving the successful result itself.  To get to that successful result, Lateral Thinking solves problems through an indirect and creative approach,  offering solutions that may not be obvious using the usual step-by-step logic. Lateral Thinking is an organized way to transfer insight into achievement.      </p>

<p>There are two elements to business problems – the approach and the end result.   A normal approach to solving problems is concerned with the right steps to reach a certain result. If you have the right steps, you will arrive at the right result.  This method works fine in science, where the situations and rules of nature never change.  Drop an apple and the law of gravity will guarantee that the result will be that it falls to the ground.  </p>

<p>This method works less well in business, where the situations and the laws of the market constantly change because of technological and cultural evolutions. Market a rotary dial phone and the technological advance of communication devices like the smartphone will guarantee it will fail. </p>

<p>
  We are concerned with the best results for your business problem, and the most effective path to get that best result.
