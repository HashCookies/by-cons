      <h2><small>Our Approach – Key Differentiator: </small> Lateral Thinking</h2>
      <p>In its approach to business solutions, we use Lateral Thinking. Lateral Thinking is concerned less with the steps to arrive at a destination, than the destination itself. Less concerned with the path to a successful results, than the successful result itself. To get to that successful result, Lateral Thinking solves problems through an indirect and creative approach – solutions that may not be obvious using the usual step-by-step logic.</p>
      <p>There are two elements to business problems – the approach and the end result. A normal approach to solving problems is concerned with the right steps to reach a certain result. If you have the right steps, you will arrive at the right result. This method works fine in science, where the situations and rules of nature never change. Drop an apple and the law of gravity will guarantee that the result will be that it falls to the ground. It works less well in business, where the situations and the laws of the market and technology constantly change. Market a rotary dial phone, and communication technological advances will guarantee it will fail.</p>
      <p>We are concerned with the best results for your business problem, and the most effective path to get that best result.</p>
